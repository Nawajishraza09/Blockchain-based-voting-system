Blockchain-Based Secure Voting System

This project is a Blockchain-Based Secure Voting System designed to ensure the integrity, transparency, and security of the voting process using modern cryptographic techniques and biometric authentication.
Key Features

1. Blockchain Integration:
         -> Ensures secure and immutable records of votes.
         -> Provides transparency and resistance to tampering.

2. Biometric Authentication:
        Voter and admin authentication using the R307 optical fingerprint reader for secure identity verification.

   i-Cryptographic Security:
        -> RSA/ECC algorithms for digitally signing voter and candidate details.
        -> SHA-256/512 hashing for ensuring document and vote integrity.

   ii-Comprehensive User Management:
        -> Voter registration includes Aadhaar ID, Voter ID, biometric fingerprint, photo, and signature, all securely stored.
        -> Candidate registration supports personal details, Aadhaar ID, Candidate ID, and party/group affiliation.

   iii-Intuitive GUI:
        -> Developed using PySide6 and PySide6-designer for a user-friendly experience.
        -> Admin panel for managing elections, registering voters and candidates, and viewing election statistics.

    iv-Data Validation:
        -> Aadhaar ID: 12-digit numerical format.
        -> Voter ID and Candidate ID: Alphanumeric format (6-10 characters).
        -> Other fields validated to ensure proper data entry.

   v-Fingerprint Management:
        -> Integration of biometric devices for capturing and validating fingerprints.
        -> Fingerprint data stored as encrypted templates and verified during authentication.

   vi-Admin Controls:
        -> Admin login using unique ID and fingerprint authentication.
        -> Ability to start/stop the voting process and view real-time election results.

3. Technologies Used

    -> Programming Language: Python
    -> GUI Framework: PySide6
    -> Database: SQLite
    -> Blockchain: (Implementation specific details here, e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger, or custom blockchain logic)
    -> Biometric Device: R307 Optical Fingerprint Reader
    -> Cryptographic Tools: PyCrypto or similar libraries for RSA/ECC and SHA-256/512
    -> Validation: QRegularExpressionValidator for input validation

5. Setup

    i-Clone the repository:
          -> git clone <repository-url>

   ii-Run the application:
          -> python demo.py

 6. Biometric Setup

  -> Ensure that the R307 fingerprint reader is connected via a USB-to-TTL UART converter (e.g., CP2102 module).
  -> Install the necessary drivers and libraries provided by the manufacturer.
  -> Update the code to ensure the correct COM port is configured.

 7. Usage

    i-Admin Panel:
        -> Admin logs in with their fingerprint and unique ID.
        -> Manage voters and candidates.
        -> Start/stop elections and view results.

    ii-Voter Registration:
        -> Enter Aadhaar ID, Voter ID, Name, and capture a fingerprint.
        -> Register voters securely with cryptographic signing and data hashing.

    iii-Voting Process:
        -> Voters log in with Aadhaar ID and fingerprint.
        -> Cast votes securely, recorded on the blockchain.

    iv-Election Results:
        -> Admins can view and export the results securely.

  8 .Future Enhancements

   -> Integration with iris scanners for added security.
   -> Advanced analytics for election results.
   -> Cross-platform compatibility for distributed voting systems.
